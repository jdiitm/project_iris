# Commit-Preparation Rules

## When to Apply
Apply these instructions **whenever you suggest code changes that are ready to be committed**, or when the user asks to prepare a commit.

## Required Output Before Any Commit Suggestion

Before suggesting a commit message or finalizing changes, ALWAYS generate the following sections in Markdown:

---

### 1. Summary of Changes
- Brief, high-level description of what changed
- Focus on behavior, not line-by-line edits

---

### 2. Architectural Impact
- Explicitly state whether this change affects:
  - System architecture
  - Data flow
  - APIs or contracts
  - Performance characteristics
  - Security or compliance
- If **no architectural change**, state: `No architectural changes`

---

### 3. Bug / Issue RCA (if applicable)
If the change fixes a bug or regression, include:
- Root cause
- Why it happened
- Why it was not caught earlier
- Whether similar issues may exist elsewhere

---

### 4. Fix & Design Decisions
Explain:
- Why this solution was chosen
- Alternatives considered (briefly)
- Trade remembered (simplicity, performance, safety, scope)

---

### 5. Reasoning Summary (No Hidden Chain-of-Thought)
Provide a **concise, user-facing reasoning summary** that explains:
- The key insights that led to the solution
- Assumptions made
- Constraints considered

⚠️ Do NOT expose internal chain-of-thought.
⚠️ Keep this as a clean, high-level explanation suitable for documentation or PR review.

---

### 6. Risk Assessment
- Potential risks introduced by the change
- Rollback considerations
- Areas to monitor after deployment

---

### 7. Suggested Commit Message

# Project Iris - Test Dependencies
# Pinned versions for deterministic test execution
# Last updated: 2026-01-22

# Core test dependencies
hypothesis==6.92.1          # Property-based testing
pytest==7.4.3               # Test framework (optional, for future migration)

# No other dependencies required - tests use Python stdlib only
# This keeps the test environment lightweight and reproducible

# Note: The test suite primarily uses:
# - unittest (stdlib)
# - socket (stdlib)
# - subprocess (stdlib)
# - threading (stdlib)
# - json (stdlib)
# - struct (stdlib)
# - random (stdlib) - MUST be seeded via tests/conftest.py
# - time (stdlib)
# - os (stdlib)
# - sys (stdlib)
# - pathlib (stdlib)
# - dataclasses (stdlib)
# - statistics (stdlib)

# Optional analysis tools (not required for test execution)
# Uncomment if needed for debugging:
# py-spy==0.3.14            # Profiling
# memory-profiler==0.61.0   # Memory analysis
